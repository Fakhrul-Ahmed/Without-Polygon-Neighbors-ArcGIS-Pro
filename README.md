# Calculating Neighboring Area Numbers without Polygon Neighbors Tool in ArcGIS-Pro

## Problem Statement

Within the scope of this project, I have devised a methodology aimed at identifying neighboring areas through the utilization of point features.


### Steps followed 

- Step 1: Open a point feature class within the project.
- Step 2: Place two points on either side when the areas are in contact with each other.
- Step 3: Utilize the spatial join tool to tally the points, thereby indicating the number of adjacent areas.

### Result

While acknowledging the tedious and challenging nature of this task, it unveils an alternative methodology.
